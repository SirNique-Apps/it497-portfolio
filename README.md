## About This Portfolio

Welcome to my IT 497 Capstone Portfolio. This site represents both my **Spiritual Progression** and **Professional Growth** during my time at Ensign College.  

This portfolio reflects not only what I have learned technically in Information Technology, but also who I am becoming as a professional guided by faith, integrity, and purpose.

As I prepare to enter the IT industry, particularly in cybersecurity and AI, I strive to integrate ethical responsibility, spiritual grounding, and technical excellence in everything I build.

# 🔹 Spiritual Progression Portfolio

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Integrity in All Things  
Integrity is the foundation of both my faith and my professional identity. In cybersecurity especially, trust is everything. I am committed to doing what is right, even when it is difficult or unseen.

### 2. Lifelong Learning and Diligent Effort  
Technology evolves rapidly. Continuous learning is essential. Spiritually and professionally, growth requires faith, effort, humility, and persistence.

### 3. Focused Vision and Purpose  
When my vision is clear and aligned with eternal priorities, my decisions become more intentional. My goal is not just career success, but meaningful impact.
